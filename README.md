R
========
To use any of the files within this repository, you can download each one individually, or you can clone the entire repository. 

There are two types of .R files within this repository, scripts and code files. Scripts end with Script.R and are meant to be run as a single piece of code. These can be run using the source command in R. Code files are meant to be run interactively or in pieces and should be opened in a GUI (may I suggest RStudio) and run as needed.
